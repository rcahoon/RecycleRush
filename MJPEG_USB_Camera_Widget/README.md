# Patched USB Webcam Viewer Widget for SmartDashboard

[Download it here](https://github.com/rcahoon/RecycleRush/blob/master/MJPEG_USB_Camera_Widget/dist/camviewer_compat.zip?raw=true)

To use, extract into your user directory, which is usually C:\\Users\\\<username\>\\ This should place a .jar file in C:\\Users\\\<username\>\\SmartDashboard\\extensions\\ (there's probably already a SmartDashboard folder in there, so it'll merge with it). Then restart SmartDashboard, and add the "USB Webcam Viewer (Compat)" widget
